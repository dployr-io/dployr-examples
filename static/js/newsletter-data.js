        content: "As with (almost) every last Friday of the month, we had our typical monthly meeting with the entire team. We received the sad news that, this month, the sales target — probably — will not be met. It was also announced that our 30th branch will open next month. Our CEO announced that with the arrival of the 50 new employees, the amount of coffee consumed increased slightly.",

        content: "Popular outcry was not silenced. But the broccoli pie protest came to a sad end. Informants claim that the result of the party at the office last Friday (26) was not friendly at all. Instead of the broccoli pie, the delivery lady brought chicken pie. The team's vegans, who currently make up 95% of the people, were disappointed."
