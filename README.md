# Old County Times

A multi-language web application demonstration showcasing [dployr's](https://github.com/dployr-io/dployr) deployment capabilities across different technology stacks. This project consists of identical newspaper generator applications built in 8 different frameworks, each implementing the same core functionality and user experience.

## Quick Start

Each implementation directory contains its own README with specific setup instructions. Generally:

1. Navigate to the desired implementation directory
2. Install dependencies (if applicable)
3. Run the application on port 3000
4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
